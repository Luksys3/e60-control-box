  This example shows how to print out the files in a
  directory on a SD card. Pin numbers reflect the default
  SPI pins for Uno and Nano models

  The circuit:
   SD card attached to SPI bus as follows:
 ** SDO - pin 11
 ** SDI - pin 12
 ** CLK - pin 13
 ** CS - depends on your SD card shield or module.
 		Pin 10 used here for consistency with other Arduino examples
    (for MKR Zero SD: SDCARD_SS_PIN)
